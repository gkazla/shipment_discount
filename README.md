Problem
----------------------------
When something is purchased, it has to be shipped, various shipping options are available. 
Each item, depending on its size gets an appropriate package size assigned to it:

  * S - Small
  * M - Medium 
  * L - Large 

Shipping price depends on package size and a provider. Approved providers with available 
package sizes and shipping prices can be fed via `providers.json` file.

E.g.
```json
[
  {
    "provider_name": "SimoSiuntos",
    "shipment_prices": {
      "S": 1.5,
      "M": 4.9,
      "L": 6.9
    }
  },
  {
    "provider_name": "JonasShipping",
    "shipment_prices": {
      "S": 2,
      "M": 3,
      "L": 4
    }
  }
]
```

Member's transactions are listed in a file 'input.txt', each line containing: date (without hours, in ISO format), 
package size code, and carrier code, separated with whitespace:
